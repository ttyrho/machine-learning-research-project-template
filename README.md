## How to use this repository

This repository provides thew basic setup I use to work in a machine learning reserarch project. Whem I am about to create a new project I just clone this repository and tweak some "variables" I use those variable to make the respository generic. You can find the location of all of those variables with the command:

```
rgrep "=:[a-zA-Z0-9]*:=" .
```

After substituting those variables you only need to remove this section and write yout own README.
